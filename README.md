# Daka Dining Backend

This is the backend API that supports the mobile application Daka Dining that I initially created for a university course.
The original backend was written in JavaScript using Express. I decided to rewrite the API as a means to learn/practice ASP.NET Web API.

## Technologies
The backend is a C# ASP.NET Web API that uses the [FastEndpoint](https://fast-endpoints.com/) Framework. I decided to use the
[REPR design pattern](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/repr-design-pattern) as suggested by FastEndpoints which allowed for better
vertical slicing of responsibilities throughout the service while also allowing for modularity and reusability.
